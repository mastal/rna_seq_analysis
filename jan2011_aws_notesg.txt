Notes on using AWS Management Console
jan2011_aws_notesg.txt

# 1. To start an instance (that has already been created):
-navigate to the EC2 window;
-from the left-hand side panel select Instances;
-main window should show a list of instances for your account,
 same as the output from the command ec2-describe-instances with
 the ec2-api-tools;
-select one of the instances by clicking the checkbox to the left
 of the instance name;
-from the InstanceActions drop-down menu select Start;
-after the panel shows the instance as running, this is when Amazon starts charging
 for hours or partial hours of instance use;   

# 2. To connect to a running instance by ssh:
- select the instance by clicking on the box to the left of the instance name;
- select Connect from the InstanceActions drop-down menu;
- sometimes you may have to click on the Refresh button for the Connect
  option to be available, otherwise it remains greyed out;
- a connect pop-up window - Connect Help - Secure Shell (SSH) should come up;
- this gives you the public DNS address for this session of your instance;
- each time you run an instance it has a different public DNS address;
- note that the line of code amazon gives you tells you to log in as 'root',
  for example: ssh -i userkey.pem root@ec2-46-51-138-117.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com ;
- apart from it generally not being a good idea to do everything as root,
  when you ssh using the above code, it usually connects, but immediately logs you out
  with a message telling you to log in as 'ec2-user' rather than as root;
- for ubuntu instances, log in as 'ubuntu' instead of 'ec2-user';
- note from the code above that you need a key pair in order to connect to an instance,
  the -i parameter is the path to the file with your key pair
- I usually also ssh with option -XYC, in case I want to do anything that requires an X-window;
- from your computer ssh to the running instance as instructed above;
- you probably have to have various environment variables and account IDs for AWS and EC2
  already set up before you can do this;

[ ec2]$ ssh -XYC -i userkey.pem  ubuntu@ec2-46-51-155-191.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com 

Warning: Permanently added 'ec2-46-51-155-191.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com,46.51.155.191' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
Linux ip-10-48-207-178 2.6.35-22-virtual #33-Ubuntu SMP Sun Sep 19 21:05:42 UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux

# 3. To mount an existing EBS volume (which is attached to the running instance):
- this part can't be done through the AWS Management Console at present,
  has to be done from the commandline from the ssh connection on the remote instance;
- what you can do through the AWS console is Create/Attach/Detach/Delete an EBS volume;
- before you can write anything to an EBS volume you have to format it, again from the 
  Linux commandline;
- once a volume is formatted you can mount it and write stuff to it;
- each time you start up an existing EBS-volume backed instance you will have to
  go through the process of mounting all the volumes attached to it (except the root volume)
  before you can read from/write to them;
- note that you only format an EBS volume the first time when you create it;
- you can use either the ec2-api tools or the AWS Management Console to see which
  volumes are attached to your instance and what mount point they are attached to;
- for the ec2-api-tools, do 'ec2-describe-volumes';
- for the AWS console, click on EC2 from the top menu bar;
- click on Volumes from the panel on the left-hand side;
- this should list all the EBS volumes belonging to your account, and show
  the volume name, size, whether they are attached to an instance, and what the 
  mount point is (/dev/sda1 is the root volume; other volumes are /dev/sdf to /dev/sdp);

- the code below will only work for volumes attached to the running instance;
- then, from the ssh connection, for example:

  $ mkdir /mnt/bowtie_color_index_and_fa
  $ mount /dev/sdh /mnt/bowtie_color_index_and_fa

- if you get an error message saying 'Permission denied', do the commands as 'sudo', i.e.:
  $ sudo mkdir /mnt/bowtie_color_index_and_fa
  $ sudo mount /dev/sdh /mnt/bowtie_color_index_and_fa

- if you need help, click on the Help button at the top left of the panel listing the EBS volumes;
- check that you can read the volume after it is mounted:

  $ cd /mnt/bowtie_color_index_and_fa
  $ ls -al
- if a program needs to write to a mounted EBS volume, you may need to change the directory permissions,
  usually the directory ownership 

   (i.e. sudo chown ubuntu /mnt/bowtie_color_index_and_fa)
  
  otherwise you will get an error message saying it can't open or write the output file;

#4. To delete a snapshot:

- from the AWS Management Console, EC2 Dashboard, on the vertical panel on the left-hand side select Snapshots;
- the main panel should list all the snapshots belonging to your account, one row for each snapshot;
- click in the box to the left of the name of the snapshot you want to delete;
- on the bar above the list of snapshots click on the button marked 'Delete';
- a pop-up window appears, with a message something like 'Are you sure you want to delete snapshot ...?';
- click yes;
- the snapshot is instantly deleted from the list;

#5. To create a snapshot of an EBS volume:

- from the AWS Management console select the EC2 tab;
- from the EC2 Dashboard, vertical panel on left-hand side, select Volumes;
- you should get a list of volumes associated with your account, one row for each volume, in the main panel,
  the same volumes listed if you use the ec2-api-tools command 'ec2-describe-volumes';
- click the box to the left of the name of the volume you want to snapshot;
- above the list of volumes, a button with 'Create Snapshot' should appear;
- click on the 'Create Snapshot' button;
- you should get a popup window with the header 'Create Snapshot' containing the volume ID
  and a box for you to enter a description of the snapshot;
- enter a description and click on 'create';
- from the EC2 Dashboard, left-hand side panel, select Snapshots;
- the new snapshot should now be listed in the main panel, if not, click on the 'Refresh'
  button above the list of snapshots;
- usually you will see an 'In Progress' sign in the 'Status' column, sometimes snapshots
  of volumes 100 Gb to 200 Gb in size seem to take a long time (a couple of hours or longer);
- on the other hand, a snapshot of the 6 Gb volume with the bowtie genome index seems to have
  been done instantly;


#6. To detach an EBS volume from an instance:

- I am not sure whether it's safe to detach a volume from a running instance
- usually I have attached/detached volumes while instances are not running
- however, today, 14/01/11, I was connected to a running instance by ssh,
  checked what was on the volume I wanted to delete, checked that I had both a snapshot
  of the volume, and a copy of the volume's contents on the IoP server, then logged out
  out of the ssh session;
- from the AWS management console, click on the EC2 tab, navigate to the left-hand side panel
  on the EC2 dashboard, select Volumes;
- check the box to the left of the name of the volume you want to detach;
- even though the instance the volume is attached to is running, the 'Detach Volume'
  button, above the list of volumes, is available;
- click the 'Detach Volume' button;
- you get a pop-up box saying 'are you sure you want to detach volume volume-ID;
  click yes;
- the volume should show as 'detaching' in the 'Attachment Information' column;
- click the 'Refresh' button at the top to show the progress;
- the attachment information is showing 'busy' rather than 'attached' or 'detached',
  even though initially it was showing as 'detaching'; this is probably because the 
  instance it is attached to is running! stop the instance and see what happens.
- when the instance stopped, the 'Attachment Information' col. for the volume
  became blank, and the 'Status' column showed a blue dot and the status 'available';
- Conclusion: you can't detach an EBS volume while an instance is running.

#7. To delete an EBS volume:

- first detach the volume;
- from the EC2/EC2 Dashboard menu select volumes;
- the main panel should show a list of volumes associated with your account;
- the 'Attachment Information' column should show which volumes are attached to which instances;
- check the box to the left of the name of the volume you want to delete, after
  first checking that it is not attached to an instance (i.e. Attachment Information column is blank);
- click on the 'Delete' button in the row above the list of volumes;
- you will get a pop-up window with a message 'Are you sure you want to delete volume volume-ID?';
- select 'yes', or 'cancel' if you don't want to delete the volume;
- if you select 'yes', the 'status' column for the volume should show a red dot and 'deleting';
- click on the 'Refresh' button on the top right of the main panel to show progress;
